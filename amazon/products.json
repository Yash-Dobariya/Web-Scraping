        "About this item": "Photography:-Nifty features such as continuous burst mode, auto image stabilization, square photos, panorama and filters make this one of the world's best phone cameras.\nThe Phone 5S is also capable of capturing full HD videos. It can capture videos in slow motion and allows zooming in while recording a video. There's also a 1.2 megapixel secondary camera for FaceTime, with better illumination sensors and larger pixels to ensure you can also video chat in HD.\nPerformance with the A7 processor, this 64-bit smartphone packs enough performance power to run games and deliver rich, detailed visual effects. The M7 Co-Processor steps up the processing capability of this smartphone, aiding in managing the phone's power.\nSignature Design:-The 5S retains the classic design of the previous Phone 5. Bridging the gap between usability and sophistication, the aluminium body is sturdy but surprisingly light. The round, sapphire crystal home button is a move forward from the previous square-shaped one.\nDisplay:-A 4\" screen with a resolution of 1136 x 640 gives the 5S a crystal clear display. The 326 ppi display is also multi-touch capable.",
